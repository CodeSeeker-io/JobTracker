# JobTracker
## What we're building
Web app for tracking job applications that also sends data to Mixpanel for analytics.

Users are able to sign up for an account using Google Oauth and providing their Mixpanel API info.
The app can be used to track and update the status of job applications. Data entered into the web app will automatically be sent to the user's Mixpanel account.
